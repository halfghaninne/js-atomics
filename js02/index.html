  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert() creates a dialog box that pops up befor a page loads. Console.log() "prints" an argument to the website's console. I still don't completely understand the functionality of console.log() other than to check returns / test javascript.</p>

  <h2> What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Tons! "You need to sign in before accessing the site" is one example.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>It would be obnoxious if every user interaction w/ a site was in the form of an alert box (they shouldnt be replacing form fields). It also seems like a bad idea to rely on alert boxes since so many people have pop-up blockers installed in their browsers. </p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>Nope. Most users will not be looking at the Console of their browser.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>As mentioned above, testing javascript / checking returns of javascript functions.</p>

  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>In this code, the console.log() statments are run after the first box is displayed and the user clicks "OK". I just found out by reloading the page (which clears the console) and watching the console carefully as the first alert popped up, as I clicked around the screen, and finally as I clicked "OK". Is there a better way to tell when things load?</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>When else might we use console.log()?</p>
